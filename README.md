#Online tool to summarize “long” videos

The goal of this project is to Build a website that accepts long videos (e.g GoPro videos of 
long hikes or dashcams of road trips) and produce a summary video. Long in this context 
means more than an hour. The site should offer different ways to summarise the long video. 
Maybe remove redundant frames, do an aggressive summary etc. Ideally, the website 
should have the ability and flexibility to plug in new video summarization systems in the 
backend.
